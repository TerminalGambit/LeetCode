**Explanation:**

The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds required for all workers working simultaneously to reduce the mountain height to zero.

**Understanding the Problem:**

- **Worker's Work Time:** For worker `i`, to reduce the mountain's height by `x`, the total time taken is `workerTimes[i] + workerTimes[i] * 2 + ... + workerTimes[i] * x`.
  
- **Simultaneous Work:** All workers work at the same time, so the total time needed is determined by the worker who finishes last.

**Approach:**

- **Binary Search on Time:** We perform a binary search on the time `t` to find the minimum time where the workers can collectively reduce the mountain height to zero.

- **Checking Feasibility (`is_possible` function):**
  - For a given time `t`, calculate the maximum amount each worker can reduce from the mountain.
  - Sum up the reductions from all workers and check if it meets or exceeds the `mountainHeight`.

**Details of the `is_possible` Function:**

1. **Calculate Maximum Work Done by Each Worker:**
   - For each worker with time `w`, calculate how much they can reduce the mountain in time `t`.
   - The total time for worker `i` to reduce the height by `x` is the sum of an arithmetic series: `workerTimes[i] * (1 + 2 + ... + x)`.
   - However, the total time is `workerTimes[i] * x * (x + 1) / 2`.

2. **Binary Search on Work Amount:**
   - For each worker, we perform a binary search to find the maximum `x` such that the total time they take is less than or equal to `t`.
   - The condition inside the binary search is `mid * (mid + 1) <= (2 * t) / w`, derived from the time formula.

3. **Aggregate the Total Reduction:**
   - Sum up the maximum `x` for all workers.
   - If the total reduction is greater than or equal to `mountainHeight`, return `True`; otherwise, `False`.

**Main Binary Search Loop:**

- We initialize `low` and `high` for the binary search on time.
- While `low < high`, we check if it's possible to reduce the mountain in `mid` seconds.
  - If possible, we try to find a smaller time (`high = mid`).
  - If not, we need more time (`low = mid + 1`).

**Test Cases:**

- **Example 1:**
  - Workers can reduce the mountain height by a total of 4 in 3 seconds.
- **Example 2:**
  - Workers collectively reduce the height by 10 in 12 seconds.
- **Example 3:**
  - A single worker reduces the height by 5 in 15 seconds.
