**Explanation:**

The problem requires us to find the total number of substrings of `word1` that can be rearranged to have `word2` as a prefix. In other words, for a substring `x` of `word1`, we need to check if there exists a permutation of `x` such that `word2` is its prefix.

**Approach:**

To solve this problem efficiently, we use a sliding window technique along with character count arrays. Here’s a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Character Count Arrays:**
   - We create two arrays of size 26 (for each lowercase English letter) to store the character counts:
     - `counts_word2`: Counts of each character in `word2`.
     - `counts_window`: Counts of each character in the current window of `word1`.

2. **Validity Check Function (`is_valid`):**
   - The function `is_valid(counts_window, counts_word2)` checks if the current window contains at least as many of each character as in `word2`.
   - It returns `True` if `counts_window[i] >= counts_word2[i]` for all characters.

3. **Sliding Window Algorithm:**
   - We initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, representing the current window in `word1`.
   - We expand the window by moving `right` from `0` to `n - 1`:
     - Update `counts_window` by incrementing the count of `word1[right]`.
     - While the current window is valid (i.e., can be rearranged to contain `word2` as a prefix):
       - **Counting Substrings:**
         - All substrings starting from `left` to `right` and ending anywhere from `right` to the end of `word1` are valid.
         - The number of such substrings is `n - right`, since the substrings can extend from `right` to `n - 1`.
         - We add `n - right` to `total_substrings`.
       - **Shrink the Window:**
         - We decrement the count of `word1[left]` in `counts_window` and increment `left` to try and find a new valid window.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - After the loop completes, we return `total_substrings`, which is the total number of valid substrings.

**Why This Works:**

- **Efficient Counting:**
  - By using the sliding window and counting all possible substrings ending at positions from `right` to `n - 1`, we avoid checking each substring individually, which would be inefficient.
- **Correctness of Counts:**
  - The `is_valid` function ensures that the current window has all the necessary characters to form `word2` as a prefix when rearranged.
- **Optimal Time Complexity:**
  - The algorithm operates in O(N) time, where N is the length of `word1`, because each character is added and removed from the window at most once.

**Test Cases Explanation:**

- **Example 1:**
  - `word1 = "bcca"`, `word2 = "abc"`
  - The only valid substring is `"bcca"` which can be rearranged to `"abcc"`, having `"abc"` as a prefix.
- **Example 2:**
  - `word1 = "abcabc"`, `word2 = "abc"`
  - All substrings of length ≥ 3 are valid because they contain at least one of each character from `"abc"`.
  - The total valid substrings are `10`.
- **Example 3:**
  - `word1 = "abcabc"`, `word2 = "aaabc"`
  - There are not enough `'a'` characters in any substring of `word1` to form `"aaabc"` as a prefix, so the result is `0`.
