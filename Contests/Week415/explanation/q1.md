**Explanation:**

The provided solution determines whether a message is spam based on the occurrence of banned words. Here's how the code works:

1. **Convert `bannedWords` to a Set:**
   - `banned_set = set(bannedWords)` creates a set from the `bannedWords` list for O(1) lookup times.

2. **Initialize a Counter:**
   - `banned_count = 0` initializes a counter to keep track of how many banned words appear in the `message`.

3. **Iterate Through `message`:**
   - The `for` loop goes through each word in the `message` list.

4. **Check for Banned Words:**
   - `if word in banned_set:` checks if the current word is in the set of banned words.
   - If it is, increment `banned_count` by 1.

5. **Determine Spam Status Early:**
   - `if banned_count >= 2:` checks if at least two banned words have been found.
   - If so, the function returns `True` immediately, indicating the message is spam.

6. **Return Result:**
   - If the loop finishes without finding at least two banned words, the function returns `False`.
